//This code is a jQuery event handler that triggers whenever any anchor link starting with "#" is clicked on the page.The event handler performs the following operations: 1. First, it uses jQuery selectors to get the target element associated with the clicked anchor link. 2. Next, if the target element exists, it prevents the default behavior(i.e., jumping to the corresponding anchor). 3. Finally, it uses jQuery's animate() method to smoothly scroll the page to where the target element is located, and does so within one second. Here's the commented code:

// Trigger whenever any anchor link starting with "#" is clicked
$('a[href^="#"]').on('click', function (event) {
    // Get the target element associated with the clicked anchor link
    var target = $(this.getAttribute('href'));

    // If target element exists, prevent default behavior (i.e., jumping to corresponding anchor)
    if (target.length) {
        event.preventDefault();

        // Smoothly scroll page to where target element is located within one second
        $('html,body').stop().animate({
            scrollTop: target.offset().top
        }, 1000);
    }
});
